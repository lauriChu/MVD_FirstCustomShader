# MVD Shader
## Description
Excercise for MVD, where we have to practise with Shader programming using custom engine.
The shaders made in this exercise are Pearl Brightness Reflection and Iridescence (is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear to gradually change colour as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. Examples of iridescence include soap bubbles, butterfly wings and seashells, as well as certain minerals. It is often created by structural coloration (microstructures that interfere with light).).
